# Non_parametric_time_series_approach
In this research we propose a non-parametric forecasting method. In order to show its versatility different time series are considered, epidemic and economic ones.
 In most of the cases the model proposed shows a better performance than the arima family of models. Great results are guaranteed in one period forecast,
 for longer periods a good performance is also reached. The methodology employed by the model allows a more real analogy with the past of the series, since the most probable
 value depends of the whole past of the serie unlike the auto regressive processes. Our contribution is based on working with the increment variable instead of the raw one.
